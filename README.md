# c1_adaptive_images

Another approach to responsive image rendering with fluid_styled_content for TYPO3.

Instead of providing a custom Imagerenderer Implemantation this extension just brings a bunch of viewHelpers which are
useful for rendering adaptive images using the normal f:image or f:media viewHelpers.
